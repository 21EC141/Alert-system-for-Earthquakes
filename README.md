Problem Statement
The primary objective is to develop a prototype system that can detect seismic activity (earthquakes) and provide timely alerts to reduce risks to life and infrastructure. This system must be capable of real-time earthquake detection and deliver alerts through an appropriate medium to ensure maximum efficacy.
